🏃‍ to run use: `node engine/engine.js` - in the project root folder.

🏃‍ Run tests use: `npm test` - in the project root folder

If you have changed the root folder (simpstacgene) to some other, change `engine/config.js` siteRoot to your folder name.

If you want your site files in a folder called something else (not portal) then update htmlRoot in `engine/config.js`.
