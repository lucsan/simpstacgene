Templates, snippets and engine/data

These are all html components.

The templates folder holds main html sections, and may have instructions.
for example:

default_tpl.html is a container by virtue of having a {{ contains }} markup token, and being referenced in other files, such as home_tpl.html

---
  contained | default
  page | index
  title | Home Page
---

note the 3 dashes which indicate an instruction is between them.
# Contained - is the html markup the home_tpl.html expects to be inserted into (ie: into default_tpl.html)
# page      - Says, this is a page (or will be) and it is called 'index'
# title     - if the page instruction is given, the page will need a title.
# contains  - used to contain a list of files grouped in a data folder

Other html files can be included, the are referenced using the file name with the _tpl.html part removed.

As can be seen in default_tpl.html, the {{ banner }} and {{ menu }} tokens will be replaced with the html markup in banner_tpl.html and menu_tpl.html respectively.

snips is just a way of keeping things neat, you can not have a snip and a template with the same name.

data allows groups of content to be mounted in a page without having to reference each one (but they will be in a big list, like a blog).
The data folder must reflect the contains instruction data.someFolderName, and the html have the {{ contains }} markup.

example:

data/list1/*.html - these files are listed in list_tpl.html

list_tpl.html
---
contains | data.list1
---

{{ contains }}
